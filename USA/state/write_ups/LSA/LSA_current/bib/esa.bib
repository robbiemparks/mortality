Title = {{The future of life expectancy and life expectancy inequalities in
   England and Wales: Bayesian spatiotemporal forecasting}},
Journal = {{Lancet}},

Volume = {{386}},

Pages = {{163-170}},
%Month = {{Jul 11}},
Abstract = {{Background To plan for pensions and health and social services, future
   mortality and life expectancy need to be forecast. Consistent forecasts
   for all subnational units within a country are very rare. Our aim was to
   forecast mortality and life expectancy for England and Wales' districts.
   Methods We developed Bayesian spatiotemporal models for forecasting of
   age-specific mortality and life expectancy at a local, small-area level.
   The models included components that accounted for mortality in relation
   to age, birth cohort, time, and space. We used geocoded mortality and
   population data between 1981 and 2012 from the Office for National
   Statistics together with the model with the smallest error to forecast
   age-specific death rates and life expectancy to 2030 for 375 of England
   and Wales' 376 districts. We measured model performance by withholding
   recent data and comparing forecasts with this withheld data.
   Findings Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales was 79.5 years
   (95\% credible interval 79.5-79.6) for men and 83.3 years (83.3-83.4)
   for women in 2012. District life expectancies ranged between 75.2 years
   (74.9-75.6) and 83.4 years (82.1-84.8) for men and between 80.2 years
   (79.8-80.5) and 87.3 years (86.0-88.8) for women. Between 1981 and 2012,
   life expectancy increased by 8.2 years for men and 6.0 years for women,
   closing the female-male gap from 6.0 to 3.8 years. National life
   expectancy in 2030 is expected to reach 85.7 (84.2-87.4) years for men
   and 87.6 (86.7-88.9) years for women, further reducing the female
   advantage to 1.9 years. Life expectancy will reach or surpass 81.4 years
   for men and reach or surpass 84.5 years for women in every district by
   2030. Longevity inequality across districts, measured as the difference
   between the 1st and 99th percentiles of district life expectancies, has
   risen since 1981, and is forecast to rise steadily to 8.3 years
   (6.8-9.7) for men and 8.3 years (7.1-9.4) for women by 2030.
   Interpretation Present forecasts underestimate the expected rise in life
   expectancy, especially for men, and hence the need to provide improved
   health and social services and pensions for elderly people in England
   and Wales. Health and social policies are needed to curb widening life
   expectancy inequalities, help deprived districts catch up in longevity
   gains, and avoid a so-called grand divergence in health and longevity.}},

Journal = {{Environmental Health Perspectives}},

Volume = {{120}},

Pages = {{19-28}},
%Month = {{Jan}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we review the epidemiological evidence on the
   relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity. We assessed the
   methodological issues in previous studies and proposed future research
   directions.
   DATA SOURCES AND DATA EXTRACTION: We searched the PubMed database for
   epidemiological studies on ambient temperature and morbidity of
   noncommunicable diseases published in refereed English journals before
   30 June 2010. Forty relevant studies were identified. Of these, 24
   examined the relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity, 15
   investigated the short-term effects of heat wave on morbidity, and 1
   assessed both temperature and heat wave effects.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Descriptive and time-series studies were the two main
   research designs used to investigate the temperature morbidity
   relationship. Measurements of temperature exposure and health outcomes
   used in these studies differed widely. The majority of studies reported
   a significant relationship between ambient temperature and total or
   cause-specific morbidities. However, there were some inconsistencies in
   the direction and magnitude of nonlinear lag effects. The lag effect of
   hot temperature on morbidity was shorter (several days) compared with
   that of cold temperature (up to a few weeks). The temperature-morbidity
   relationship may be confounded or modified by sociodemographic factors
   and air pollution.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant short-term effect of ambient
   temperature on total and cause-specific morbidities. However, further
   research is needed to determine an appropriate temperature measure,
   consider a diverse range of morbidities, and to use consistent
   methodology to make different studies more comparable.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths
   attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so
   far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range
   in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the
   total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature,
   and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and
   extreme temperatures.
   Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil,
   Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan,
   Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model
   for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We
   estimated temperature-mortality associations with a distributed lag
   non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a
   multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and
   temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for
   heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum
   temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and
   for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the
   2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles.
   Findings We analysed 74 225 200 deaths in various periods between 1985
   and 2012. In total, 7.71\% (95\% empirical CI 7.43-7.91) of mortality
   was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries
   within the study period, with substantial differences between countries,
   ranging from 3.37\% (3.06 to 3.63) in Thailand to 11.00\% (9.29 to
   12.47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied
   from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80-90th
   percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths
   were caused by cold (7.29\%, 7.02-7.49) than by heat (0.42\%,
   0.39-0.44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for
   0.86\% (0.84-0.87) of total mortality.
   Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was
   attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme
   temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but
   non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the
   planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health
   consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future
   effect in climate-change scenarios. Copyright (C) Gasparrini et al. Open

Abstract = {{``Climate dice,{''} describing the chance of unusually warm or cool
   seasons, have become more and more ``loaded{''} in the past 30 y,
   coincident with rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonal mean
   temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the
   range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence
   of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three
   standard deviations (3 sigma) warmer than the climatology of the
   1951-1980 base period. This hot extreme, which covered much less than
   1\% of Earth's surface during the base period, now typically covers
   about 10\% of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high
   degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and
   Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming
   because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was
   exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications of this
   substantial, growing, climate change.}},

   fields for Europe back to 1500 show that the late 20th- and early

   findings for the entire Northern Hemisphere. European winter average
   temperatures during the period 1500 to 1900 were reduced by similar
   to0.5degreesC (0.25degreesC for annual mean temperatures) compared to
   the 20th century. Summer temperatures did not experience systematic
   century-scale cooling relative to present conditions. The coldest
   European winter was 1708/1709; 2003 was by far the hottest summer.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many studies have linked weather to mortality; however, role
   of such critical factors as regional variation, susceptible populations,
   and acclimatization remain unresolved.
   Methods: We applied time-series models to 107 US communities allowing a
   nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality by using a
   14-year dataset. Second-stage analysis was used to relate cold, heat,
   and heat wave effect estimates to community-specific variables. We
   considered exposure timeframe, susceptibility, age, cause of death, and
   confounding from pollutants. Heat waves were modeled with varying
   intensity and duration.
   Results: Heat-related mortality was most associated with a shorter lag
   (average of same day and previous day), with an overall increase of
   3.0\% (95\% posterior interval: 2.4\%-3.6\%) in mortality risk comparing
   the 99th and 90th percentile temperatures for the community.
   Cold-related mortality was most associated with a longer lag (average of
   current day up to 25 days previous), with a 4.2\% (3.2\%-5.3\%) increase
   in risk comparing the first and 10th percentile temperatures for the
   community. Mortality risk increased with the intensity or duration of
   heat waves. Spatial heterogeneity in effects indicates that
   weather-mortality relationships from I community may not be applicable
   in another. Larger spatial heterogeneity for absolute temperature
   estimates (comparing risk at specific temperatures) than for relative
   temperature estimates (comparing risk at community-specific temperature
   percentiles) provides evidence for acclimatization. We identified
   susceptibility based on age, socioeconomic conditions, urbanicity, and
   central air conditioning.
   Conclusions: Acclimatization, individual susceptibility, and community
   characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.}},

   studies from 2001 to 2008}},
Journal = {{Environmental Health}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
%Month = {{Sep 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: This review examines recent evidence on mortality from
   elevated ambient temperature for studies published from January 2001 to
   December 2008.
   Methods: PubMed was used to search for the following keywords:
   temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality. The
   search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies.
   Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat
   waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient
   temperature and mortality in a variety of locations. Studies focusing on
   cold temperature effects were also excluded.
   Results: Thirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1)
   elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as
   confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature
   and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated
   ambient temperature-mortality association. The evidence suggests that
   particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and
   ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier
   in the warmer months in some locations. Nonetheless, the independent
   effect of temperature and mortality was withheld. Elevated temperature
   was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular,
   respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases,
   such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial
   infarction. Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic
   group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age
   groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants
   and young children.
   Conclusion: Many of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only
   been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study
   population. Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas,
   are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{Jan 30}},
Abstract = {{The case-crossover design uses cases only, and compares exposures just
   prior to the event times to exposures at comparable control, or
   `referent' times, in order to assess the effect of short-term exposure
   on the risk of a rare event. It has commonly been used to study the
   effect of air pollution on the risk of various adverse health events.
   Proper selection of referents is crucial, especially with air pollution
   exposures, which are shared, highly seasonal, and often have a long-term
   time trend. Hence, careful referent selection is important to control
   for time-varying confounders, and in order to ensure that the
   distribution of exposure is constant across referent times, a key
   assumption of this method. Yet the referent strategy is important for a
   more basic reason: the conditional logistic regression estimating
   equations commonly used are biased when referents are not chosen a
   priori and are functions of the observed event times. We call this bias
   in the estimating equations overlap bias. In this paper, we propose a
   new taxonomy of referent selection strategies in order to emphasize
   their statistical properties. We give a derivation of overlap bias,
   explore its magnitude, and consider how the bias depends on properties
   of the exposure series. We conclude that the bias is usually small,
   though highly unpredictable, and easily avoided. Copyright (C) 2004 John

Month = {{Jan}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Several observational studies have suggested an association
   between high temperatures and all-cause mortality. However, estimates on
   more specific mortality outcomes are sparse, and frequently assessed in
   studies using different analytical methods.
   Methods A time series analysis was performed on 10 regions in England
   and Wales during the summers (June-September) of 1993-2006. Average
   percentage linear increases in risk for a 1 degrees C increase in
   temperature above region-specific thresholds and attributable deaths
   were computed by cause-specific mortality and age groups (0-64, 65-74,
   75-84, 85+).
   Results There was evidence of increased mortality with heat for almost
   all cause-of-death groups examined, with an overall increase in
   all-cause mortality of 2.1\% (95\% CI 1.6\% to 2.6\%) for a 1 degrees C
   rise above the regional heat threshold. Among main causes, the steepest
   increase in risk was for respiratory mortality (+4.1\% (3.5\% to 4.8\%)
   per 1 degrees C). It was much smaller for cardiovascular causes (+1.8\%
   (1.2\% to 2.5\%)) and myocardial infarction (+1.1\% (0.7\% to 1.5\%)),
   but comparatively high for arrhythmias (+5.0\% (3.2\% to 6.9\%)) and
   pulmonary heart disease (+8.3\% (2.7\% to 14.3\%)). Among
   non-cardiorespiratory causes, the strongest effects were for
   genitourinary (+3.8\% (2.9\% to 4.7\%)) and nervous system (+4.6\%
   (3.7\% to 5.4\%)) disorders. 33.9\% of heat deaths were attributable to
   cardiovascular causes, 24.7\% to respiratory causes and 41.3\% to all
   other causes combined.
   Conclusions These results suggest that the risk of heat-related
   mortality is distributed across a wide range of different causes, and
   that targeting of preventative actions based on pre-existing disease is
   unlikely to be efficient.}},

Journal = {{Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background It is well known that high ambient temperatures are
   associated with increased mortality, even in temperate climates, but
   some important details are unclear. In particular, how heat-mortality
   associations (for example, slopes and thresholds) vary by climate has
   previously been considered only qualitatively.
   Methods An ecological time-series regression analysis of daily counts of
   all-cause mortality and ambient temperature in summers between 1993 and
   2006 in the 10 government regions was carried out, focusing on all-cause
   mortality and 2-day mean temperature (lags 0 and 1).
   Results All regions showed evidence of increased risk on the hottest
   days, but the specifics, in particular the threshold temperature at
   which adverse effects started, varied. Thresholds were at about the same
   centile temperatures (the 93rd, year-round) in all regions-hotter
   climates had higher threshold temperatures. Mean supra-threshold slope
   was 2.1\%/degrees C (95\% CI 1.6 to 2.6), but regions with higher summer
   temperatures showed greater slopes, a pattern well characterised by a
   linear model with mean summer temperature. These climate-based
   linear-threshold models capture most, but not all, the association;
   there was evidence for some non-linearity above thresholds, with slope
   increasing at highest temperatures.
   Conclusion Effects of high daily summer temperatures on mortality in
   English regions are quite well approximated by threshold-linear models
   that can be predicted from the region's climate (93rd centile and mean
   summer temperature). It remains to be seen whether similar relationships
   fit other countries and climates or change over time, such as with
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme heat is an important weather hazard associated with excess
   mortality and morbidity. We determine the relative importance of heat
   exposure and the built environment, socioeconomic vulnerability, and
   neighborhood stability for heat mortality (Philadelphia, PA, USA) or
   heat distress (Phoenix, AZ, USA), using an ecologic study design. We use
   spatial Generalized Linear and Mixed Models to account for
   non-independence (spatial autocorrelation) between neighboring census
   block groups. Failing to account for spatial autocorrelation can provide
   misleading statistical results. Phoenix neighborhoods with more heat
   exposure, Black, Hispanic, linguistically and socially isolated
   residents, and vacant households made more heat distress calls.
   Philadelphia heat mortality neighborhoods were more likely to have low
   housing values and a higher proportion of Black residents. Our
   methodology can identify important risk factors and geographic areas to
   target interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

AB Background: Many studies have linked weather to mortality; however, role of such critical factors as regional variation, susceptible populations, and acclimatization remain unresolved.
   Methods: We applied time-series models to 107 US communities allowing a nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality by using a 14-year dataset. Second-stage analysis was used to relate cold, heat, and heat wave effect estimates to community-specific variables. We considered exposure timeframe, susceptibility, age, cause of death, and confounding from pollutants. Heat waves were modeled with varying intensity and duration.
   Results: Heat-related mortality was most associated with a shorter lag (average of same day and previous day), with an overall increase of 3.0% (95% posterior interval: 2.4%-3.6%) in mortality risk comparing the 99th and 90th percentile temperatures for the community. Cold-related mortality was most associated with a longer lag (average of current day up to 25 days previous), with a 4.2% (3.2%-5.3%) increase in risk comparing the first and 10th percentile temperatures for the community. Mortality risk increased with the intensity or duration of heat waves. Spatial heterogeneity in effects indicates that weather-mortality relationships from I community may not be applicable in another. Larger spatial heterogeneity for absolute temperature estimates (comparing risk at specific temperatures) than for relative temperature estimates (comparing risk at community-specific temperature percentiles) provides evidence for acclimatization. We identified susceptibility based on age, socioeconomic conditions, urbanicity, and central air conditioning.
   Conclusions: Acclimatization, individual susceptibility, and community characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.

Abstract = {{In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on
   ``Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease{''} concluded that exposure
   to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular
   morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded
   our understanding of this association and further elucidated the
   physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of
   this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to
   provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure
   with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the
   clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The
   writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many
   aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for
   areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review,
   several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure
   to PM <2.5 mu m in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can
   trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events;
   longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for
   cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a
   few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments
   of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM
   levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within
   a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological
   mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to
   these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall
   evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure
   and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has
   grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart
   Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure
   is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular
   morbidity and mortality. (Circulation. 2010; 121: 2331-2378.)}},

   The average incidence rate ratio for a hypothesized effect period
   following the exposure is estimable using the Mantel-Haenszel estimator.
   The duration of the effect period is assumed to be that which maximizes
   the rate ratio estimate.  Self-matching of cases eliminates the threat
   of control-selection bias and increases efficiency.  Pilot data from a

   within-individual confounding due to temporal association of exposures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the high burden from exposure to both hot and cold
   weather each year in England and Wales, there has been relatively little
   investigation on who is most at risk, resulting in uncertainties in
   informing government interventions.
   Objective: To determine the subgroups of the population that are most
   vulnerable to heat-related and cold-related mortality.
   Methods: Ecological time-series study of daily mortality in all regions
   of England and Wales between 1993 and 2003, with postcode linkage of
   individual deaths to a UK database of all care and nursing homes, and
   2001 UK census small-area indicators.
   Results: A risk of mortality was observed for both heat and cold
   exposure in all regions, with the strongest heat effects in London and
   strongest cold effects in the Eastern region. For all regions, a mean
   relative risk of 1.03 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.03) was
   estimated per degree increase above the heat threshold, defined as the
   95th centile of the temperature distribution in each region, and 1.06
   (95\% CI 1.05 to 1.06) per degree decrease below the cold threshold (set
   at the 5th centile). Elderly people, particularly those in nursing and
   care homes, were most vulnerable. The greatest risk of heat mortality
   was observed for respiratory and external causes, and in women, which
   remained after control for age. Vulnerability to either heat or cold was
   not modified by deprivation, except in rural populations where cold
   effects were slightly stronger in more deprived areas.
   Conclusions: Interventions to reduce vulnerability to both hot and cold
   weather should target all elderly people. Specific interventions should
   also be developed for people in nursing and care homes as heat illness
   is easily preventable.}},

Journal = {{Epidemiology}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{613-620}},
Month = {{Sep}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mortality increases with hot weather, although the extent to
   which lives are shortened is rarely quantified. We compare the extent to
   which short-term mortality displacement can explain heat deaths in
   Delhi, Sao Paulo, and London given contrasting demographic and health
   profiles.
   Methods: We examined time-series of daily mortality data in relation to
   daily ambient temperature using Poisson models and adjusting for season,
   relative humidity, rainfall, particulate air pollution, day of the week,
   and public holidays. We used unconstrained distributed lag models to
   identify the extent to which heat-related excesses were followed by
   deficits (mortality displacement).
   Results: For each city, an increase in all-cause mortality was observed
   with same-day (lag 0) and previous day (lag 1) temperatures greater than
   a threshold of 20 degrees C. At lag 0, the excess risk was greatest in
   Delhi and smallest in London. In Delhi, an excess was apparent up to 3
   weeks after exposure, after which a deficit was observed that offset
   just part of the overall excess. In London, the heat excess persisted
   only 2 days and was followed by deficits, such that the sum of effects
   was 0 by day 11. The pattern in Sao Paulo was intermediate between
   these. The risk summed over the course of 28 days was 2.4\% (95\%
   confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.7\%) per degree greater than the heat
   threshold in Delhi, 0.8\% (- 0.4 to 2.1\%) in Sao Paulo and -1.6\% (-3.4
   to 0.3\%) in London. Excess risks were sustained up to 4 weeks for
   respiratory deaths in Sao Paulo and London and for children in Delhi.
   Conclusions: Heat-related short-term mortality displacement was high in
   London but less in Delhi, where infectious and childhood mortality still
   predominate.}},

Title = {{Reducing and meta-analysing estimates from distributed lag non-linear
   models}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{Jan 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The two-stage time series design represents a powerful
   analytical tool in environmental epidemiology. Recently, models for both
   stages have been extended with the development of distributed lag
   non-linear models (DLNMs), a methodology for investigating
   simultaneously non-linear and lagged relationships, and multivariate
   meta-analysis, a methodology to pool estimates of multi-parameter
   associations. However, the application of both methods in two-stage
   analyses is prevented by the high-dimensional definition of DLNMs.
   Methods: In this contribution we propose a method to synthesize DLNMs to
   simpler summaries, expressed by a reduced set of parameters of
   one-dimensional functions, which are compatible with current
   multivariate meta-analytical techniques. The methodology and modelling
   framework are implemented in R through the packages dlnm and mvmeta.
   Results: As an illustrative application, the method is adopted for the
   two-stage time series analysis of temperature-mortality associations
   using data from 10 regions in England and Wales. R code and data are
   available as supplementary online material.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The methodology proposed here extends the
   use of DLNMs in two-stage analyses, obtaining meta-analytical estimates
   of easily interpretable summaries from complex non-linear and delayed
   associations. The approach relaxes the assumptions and avoids
   simplifications required by simpler modelling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Details about the impact of extreme cold on cardiovascular mortality are
   little known in the countries with warm winters like Taiwan. This study
   aimed to examine the ecological associations between various social
   determinants and cardiovascular mortality after cold surges in Taiwan
   with a spatial perspective focusing on spatial non-stationarity. The
   mortality rates at township level in Taiwan were observed from 1997 to
   2003. Five social determinants (social disadvantage, lack of economic
   opportunity, stability, sensitive group, and rurality) were created with
   the 2000 Taiwan Census data. We analyzed the data using Geographically
   Weighted Poisson Regression. On average, an immediate increase in
   cardiovascular mortality was found right after cold surges. All of the
   five determinants were found to have spatial non-stationary effects on
   the cardiovascular mortality rates after cold surges. This finding
   provided an empirical basis for developing public health programs with
   local emphases on the impacts of extreme cold. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Pages = {{1041-1054}},
Month = {{Jun 30}},
Abstract = {{Monthly or annual 5 km x 5 km gridded datasets covering the UK are
   generated for the 1961-2000 period, for 36 climatic parameters. As well
   as the usual elements of temperature, rainfall, sunshine, cloud, wind
   speed, and pressure, derived temperature variables (such as
   growing-season length, heating degree days, and heat and cold wave
   durations) and further precipitation variables (such as rainfall
   intensity, maximum consecutive dry days, and days of snow, hail and
   thunder) are analysed.
   The analysis process uses geographical information system capabilities
   to combine multiple regression with inverse-distance-weighted
   interpolation. Geographic and topographic factors, such as easting and
   northing, terrain height and shape, and urban and coastal effects, are
   incorporated either through normalization with regard to the 1961-90
   average climate, or as independent variables in the regression. Local
   variations are then incorporated through the spatial interpolation of
   regression residuals.
   For each of the climatic parameters, the choice of model is based on
   verification statistics produced by excluding a random set of stations
   from the analysis for a selection of months, and comparing the observed
   values with the estimated values at each point. This gives some insight
   into the significance, direction, and seasonality of factors affecting
   different climate elements. It also gives a measure of the accuracy of
   the method at predicting values between station locations.
   The datasets are being used for the verification of climate modelling
   scenarios and are available via the Internet. (c) Crown Copyright 2005.

Title = {{Temperature, temperature extremes, and mortality: a study of

Journal = {{OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{827-833}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The authors examined the increase in mortality associated
   with hot and cold temperature in different locations, the determinants
   of the variability in effect estimates, and its implications for
   adaptation.
   Methods: The authors conducted a case-crossover study in 50 US cities.
   They used daily mortality and weather data for 6 513 330 deaths
   occurring during 1989 -2000. Exposure was assessed using two approaches.
   First, the authors determined exposure to extreme temperatures using
   city-specific indicator variables based on the local temperature
   distribution. Secondly, they used piecewise linear variables to assess
   exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/ below a threshold.
   Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific
   models. In a meta-analysis of the city-specific results, the authors
   examined several city characteristics as effect modifiers.
   Results: Mortality increases associated with both extreme cold (2-day
   cumulative increase 1.59\% (95\% CI 0.56 to 2.63)) and extreme heat
   (5.74\% (95\% CI 3.38 to 8.15)) were found, the former being especially
   marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest deaths. The increase
   in mortality was less marked at less extreme temperatures. The effect of
   extreme cold (defined as a percentile) was homogeneous across cities
   with different climates, suggesting that only the unusualness of the
   cold temperature (and not its absolute value) had a substantial impact
   on mortality (that is, acclimatisation to cold). Conversely, heat
   effects were quite heterogeneous, with the largest effects observed in
   cities with milder summers, less air conditioning and higher population
   density. Adjustment for ozone led to similar results, but some residual
   confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutants.
   Conclusions: The authors confirmed in a large sample of cities that both
   cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk. These findings
   suggest that increases in heat-related mortality due to global warming
   are unlikely to be compensated for by decreases in cold-related
   mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still
   incomplete.}},

Journal = {{Environmental Health Perspectives}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-67}},
Month = {{Jan}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Climate models project that heat waves will increase in
   frequency and severity. Despite many studies of mortality from heat
   waves, few studies have examined morbidity.
   OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether any age or
   race/ethnicity groups experienced increased hospitalizations and
   emergency department (ED) visits overall or for selected illnesses
   during the 2006 California heat wave.
   METHODS: We aggregated county-level hospitalizations and ED visits for
   all causes and for 10 cause groups into six geographic regions of
   California. We calculated excess morbidity and rate ratios (RRs) during
   the heat wave (15 July to 1 August 2006) and compared these data with
   those of a reference period (8-14 July and 12-22 August 2006).
   RESULTS: During the heat wave, 16,166 excess ED visits and 1,182 excess
   hospitalizations occurred statewide. ED visits for heat-related causes
   increased across the state {[}RR = 6.30; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   5.67-7.01], especially in the Central Coast region, which includes San
   Francisco. Children (0-4 years of age) and the elderly (>= 65 years of
   age) were at greatest risk. ED visits also showed significant increases
   for acute renal failure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, electrolyte
   imbalance, and nephritis. We observed significantly elevated RRs for
   hospitalizations for heat-related ill-nesses (RR = 10.15; 95\% CI,
   7.79-13.43), acute renal Failure, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 California heat wave had a substantial effect on
   morbidity, including regions with relatively modest temperatures. This
   suggests that population acclimatization and adaptive capacity
   influenced risk. By better understanding these impacts and population
   vulnerabilities, local communities can improve heat wave preparedness to
   cope with a globally warming future.}},

   County, USA, from 1983-2008: a case-series analysis}},
Journal = {{Environmental Health}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{Mar 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: High temperature and humidity conditions are associated with
   short-term elevations in the mortality rate in many United States
   cities. Previous research has quantified this relationship in an
   aggregate manner over large metropolitan areas, but within these areas
   the response may differ based on local-scale variability in climate,
   population characteristics, and socio economic factors.
   Methods: We compared the mortality response for 48 Zip Code Tabulation
   Areas (ZCTAs) comprising Philadelphia County, PA to determine if certain
   areas are associated with elevated risk during high heat stress
   conditions. A randomization test was used to identify mortality
   exceedances for various apparent temperature thresholds at both the city
   and local scale. We then sought to identify the environmental,
   demographic, and social factors associated with high-risk areas via
   principal components regression.
   Results: Citywide mortality increases by 9.3\% on days following those
   with apparent temperatures over 34 degrees C observed at 7:00 p.m. local
   time. During these conditions, elevated mortality rates were found for
   10 of the 48 ZCTAs concentrated in the west-central portion of the
   County. Factors related to high heat mortality risk included proximity
   to locally high surface temperatures, low socioeconomic status, high
   density residential zoning, and age.
   Conclusions: Within the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area, there
   exists statistically significant fine-scale spatial variability in the
   mortality response to high apparent temperatures. Future heat warning
   systems and mitigation and intervention measures could target these high
   risk areas to reduce the burden of extreme weather on summertime
   morbidity and mortality.}},

Journal = {{Environmental Health Perspectives}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-28}},
%Month = {{Jan}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we review the epidemiological evidence on the
   relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity. We assessed the
   methodological issues in previous studies and proposed future research
   directions.
   DATA SOURCES AND DATA EXTRACTION: We searched the PubMed database for
   epidemiological studies on ambient temperature and morbidity of
   noncommunicable diseases published in refereed English journals before
   30 June 2010. Forty relevant studies were identified. Of these, 24
   examined the relationship between ambient temperature and morbidity, 15
   investigated the short-term effects of heat wave on morbidity, and 1
   assessed both temperature and heat wave effects.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Descriptive and time-series studies were the two main
   research designs used to investigate the temperature morbidity
   relationship. Measurements of temperature exposure and health outcomes
   used in these studies differed widely. The majority of studies reported
   a significant relationship between ambient temperature and total or
   cause-specific morbidities. However, there were some inconsistencies in
   the direction and magnitude of nonlinear lag effects. The lag effect of
   hot temperature on morbidity was shorter (several days) compared with
   that of cold temperature (up to a few weeks). The temperature-morbidity
   relationship may be confounded or modified by sociodemographic factors
   and air pollution.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant short-term effect of ambient
   temperature on total and cause-specific morbidities. However, further
   research is needed to determine an appropriate temperature measure,
   consider a diverse range of morbidities, and to use consistent
   methodology to make different studies more comparable.}},

   daily mortality in the Barcelona metropolitan area during the warm
   seasons of 1999-2006. Temperature data on the date of death were
   assigned to each individual, which were assigned to their census tract
   of residence. Eight census tract-level variables on socioeconomic or
   built environment characteristics were obtained from the census.
   Residence surrounding greenness was obtained from satellite data. The
   relative risk (RR) of mortality after three consecutive hot days
   (defined as those exceeding the 95th percentile of maximum temperature)
   was calculated via conditional logistic regression. Effect modification
   was examined by including interaction terms.
   Results Analyses were based on 52 806 deaths. The effect of three
   consecutive hot days was a 30\% increase in all-cause mortality
   (RR=1.30, 95\% CI 1.24 to 1.38). Heterogeneity of this effect was
   observed across census tracts. The effect of heat on mortality was
   higher in the census tracts with a large percentage of old buildings (RR
   = 1.21, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.46), manual workers (RR = 1.25, 95\% CI 0.96
   to 1.64) and residents perceiving little surrounding greenness (RR =
   1.29, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.65). After three consecutive hot days, mortality
   doubled in the most heat-vulnerable census tracts.
   Conclusions Sociodemographic and urban landscape characteristics are
   associated to mortality risk during heat waves and are useful to build
   heat vulnerability maps.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental changes caused by climate change represent a
   significant challenge to human societies. One part of this challenge
   will be greater heat-related mortality. Populations in the northern
   hemisphere will experience temperature increases exceeding the global
   average, but whether this will increase or decrease total
   temperature-related mortality burdens is debated. Here, we use
   distributed lag modeling to characterize temperature-mortality
   relationships in 15 Canadian cities. Further, we examine historical
   trends in temperature variation across Canada. We then develop
   city-specific general linear models to estimate change in high- and
   low-temperature-related mortality using dynamically downscaled climate
   projections for four future periods centred on 2040, 2060 and 2080. We
   find that the minimum mortality temperature is frequently located at
   approximately the 75th percentile of the city's temperature
   distribution, and that Canadians currently experience greater and longer
   lasting risk from cold-related than heat-related mortality.
   Additionally, we find no evidence that temperature variation is
   increasing in Canada. However, the projected increased temperatures are
   sufficient to change the relative levels of heat- and cold-related
   mortality in some cities. While most temperature-related mortality will
   continue to be cold-related, our models predict that higher temperatures
   will increase the burden of annual temperature-related mortality in
   Hamilton, London, Montreal and Regina, but result in slight to moderate
   decreases in the burden of mortality in the other 11 cities
   investigated.}},

Journal = {{Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{Jul}},
Abstract = {{Background The most direct way in which climate change is expected to
   affect public health relates to changes in mortality rates associated
   with exposure to ambient temperature. Many countries worldwide
   experience annual heat-related and cold-related deaths associated with
   current weather patterns. Future changes in climate may alter such
   risks. Estimates of the likely future health impacts of such changes are
   needed to inform public health policy on climate change in the UK and
   elsewhere.
   Methods Time-series regression analysis was used to characterise current
   temperature-mortality relationships by region and age group. These were
   then applied to the local climate and population projections to estimate
   temperature-related deaths for the UK by the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s.
   Greater variability in future temperatures as well as changes in mean
   levels was modelled.
   Results A significantly raised risk of heat-related and cold-related
   mortality was observed in all regions. The elderly were most at risk. In
   the absence of any adaptation of the population, heat-related deaths
   would be expected to rise by around 257\% by the 2050s from a current
   annual baseline of around 2000 deaths, and cold-related mortality would
   decline by 2\% from a baseline of around 41 000 deaths. The cold burden
   remained higher than the heat burden in all periods. The increased
   number of future temperature-related deaths was partly driven by
   projected population growth and ageing.
   Conclusions Health protection from hot weather will become increasingly
   necessary, and measures to reduce cold impacts will also remain
   important in the UK. The demographic changes expected this century mean
   that the health protection of the elderly will be vital.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Heat-related mortality is a matter of great public health
   concern, especially in the light of climate change. Although many
   studies have found associations between high temperatures and mortality,
   more research is needed to project the future impacts of climate change
   on heat-related mortality.
   OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review of research and methods for
   projecting future heat-related mortality under climate change scenarios.
   DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: A literature search was conducted in August
   2010, using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Pro
   Quest, and Web of Science. The search was limited to peer-reviewed
   journal articles published in English from January 1980 through July
   2010.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most
   projections showed that climate change would result in a substantial
   increase in heat-related mortality. Projecting heat-related mortality
   requires understanding historical temperature mortality relationships
   and considering the future changes in climate, population, and
   acclimatization. Further research is needed to provide a stronger
   theoretical framework for projections, including a better understanding
   of socioeconomic development, adaptation strategies, land-use patterns,
   air pollution, and mortality displacement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Scenario-based projection research will meaningfully
   contribute to assessing and managing the potential impacts of climate
   change on heat-related mortality.}},

   for three cities in Quebec, Canada}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{May 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The impact of climate change and particularly increasing
   temperature on mortality has been examined for three cities in the
   province of Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: Generalized linear Poisson regression has been fitted to the
   total daily mortality for each city. Smooth parametric cubic splines of
   temperature and humidity have been used to do nonlinear modeling of
   these parameters. The model, to control for day of the week and for
   non-temperature seasonal factors, used a smooth function of time,
   including delayed effects. The model was then used to assess variation
   in mortality for simulated future temperatures obtained from an
   atmospheric General Circulation Model coupled with downscaling
   regression techniques. Two CO2 emission scenarios are considered
   (scenarios A2 and B2). Projections are made for future periods around
   year 2020 (2010-2039), 2050 (2040-2069) and 2080 (2070-2099).
   Results: A significant association between mortality and current
   temperature has been found for the three cities. Under CO2 emission
   scenarios A2 and B2, the mortality model predicts a significant increase
   in mortality in the summertime, and a smaller, but significant decrease
   in the fall season. The slight variations in projected mortality for
   future winter and spring seasons were found to be not statistically
   significant. The variations in projected annual mortality are dominated
   by an increase in mortality in the summer, which is not balanced by the
   decrease in mortality in the fall and winter seasons. The summer
   increase and the annual mortality range respectively from about 2\% and
   0.5\% for the 2020 period, to 10\% and 3\% for the years around 2080.
   The difference between the mortality variations projected with the A2 or
   B2 scenarios was not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: For the three cities, the two CO2 emission scenarios
   considered led to an increase in annual mortality, which contrasts with
   most European countries, where the projected increase in summer
   mortality with respect to climate change is overbalanced by the decrease
   in winter mortality. This highlights the importance of place in such
   analyses. The method proposed here to establish these estimates is
   general and can also be applied to small cities, where mortality rates
   are relatively low (ex. two deaths/day).}},

Journal = {{OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{584-591}},
Month = {{Sep}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Exposure to ambient temperature can affect mortality levels
   for days or weeks following exposure, making modelling such effects in
   regression analysis of daily time-series data complex.
   Methods: We propose a new approach involving a multilag segmented
   approximation to account for the non-linear effect of temperature and
   the use of two different penalised spline bases to model the distributed
   lag of both heat and cold exposure. Compared with standard splines, the
   novel penalised framework is more flexible at short lags where change in
   coefficients is greatest, and selection of the maximum lag appears
   substantially less important in determining the overall pattern of the
   effect.
   Results: Applying the approach to daily mortality in Santiago (Chile)
   and Palermo (Italy), we observed a heat effect that was mostly immediate
   and followed by negative estimates consistent with short-term mortality
   displacement (harvesting). Cold effects were mostly positively sustained
   and more evenly distributed across the 60-day analysis period: in
   Santiago we estimated an overall increase in deaths of 2.36\% (95\% Cl
   0.26\% to 4.51\%) in the 65+ age group associated with every 1 degrees C
   decrease below the cold threshold, and an increase of 1.11\% (0.09\% to
   2.14\%) per 1 degrees C for Palermo. Heat effects for Palermo were much
   larger than for Santiago, and less harvesting of heat deaths was
   evident. The estimated heat thresholds were higher in Palermo than in
   Santiago.
   Conclusions: Our approach provides a flexible and precise method to
   quantify health effects of both heat and cold exposure at individual
   lags and to model the overall pattern of the delayed effect.}},

Pages = {{65-73}},
Abstract = {{Over the coming century, climate change is projected to increase both
   mean and extreme temperatures as heat waves become more frequent,
   intense, and long-lived. The city of Chicago has already experienced a
   number of severe heat waves, with a 1995 event estimated to be
   responsible for nearly 800 deaths. Here, future projections under SRES
   higher (A1FI) and lower (B1) emission scenarios are used to estimate the
   frequency of 1995-like heat wave events in terms of both meteorological
   characteristics and impacts on heat-related mortality. Before end of
   century, 1995-like heat waves could occur every other year on average
   under lower emissions and as frequently as three times per year under
   higher. Annual average mortality rates are projected to equal those of
   1995 under lower emissions and reach twice 1995 levels under higher. An
   ``analog city{''} analysis, transposing the weather conditions from the
   European Heat Wave of 2003 (responsible for 70,000 deaths across Europe)
   to the city of Chicago, estimates that if a similar heat wave were to
   occur over Chicago, more than ten times the annual average number of
   heat-related deaths could occur in just a few weeks. Climate projections
   indicate that an EHW-type heat wave could occur in Chicago by
   mid-century. Between mid- and end-of-century, there could be as many as
   five such events under lower, and twenty-five under higher emissions.
   These results highlight the importance of both preventive mitigation and
   responsive adaptation strategies in reducing the vulnerability of
   Chicago's population to climate change-induced increases in extreme
   heat. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The steady increase in greenhouse gas concentrations is inducing a
   detectable rise in global temperatures. The sensitivity of human
   societies to warming temperatures is, however, a transcendental question
   not comprehensively addressed to date. Here we show the link between
   temperature, humidity and daily numbers of deaths in nearly 200 European
   regions, which are subsequently used to infer transient projections of
   mortality under state-of-the-art high-resolution greenhouse gas scenario
   simulations. Our analyses point to a change in the seasonality of
   mortality, with maximum monthly incidence progressively shifting from
   winter to summer. The results also show that the rise in heat-related
   mortality will start to completely compensate the reduction of deaths
   from cold during the second half of the century, amounting to an average
   drop in human lifespan of up 3-4 months in 2070-2100. Nevertheless,
   projections suggest that human lifespan might indeed increase if a
   substantial degree of adaptation to warm temperatures takes place.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of overall temperature and the frequency of heat waves
   maybe shifting due to climate change. However, forecasting future health
   consequences of higher temperatures in a given city is complicated by
   uncertainties in how populations and societal infrastructure will adapt.
   This paper reviews approaches to address these challenges, including:
   (1) using historical weather-mortality relationships for the same
   region, or a location with a similar climate as the city of interest;
   (2) evaluating adaptation using the minimum mortality threshold (MMT)
   temperature (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate); and
   (3) estimating the impact of modifiers (e.g., air conditioning,
   population density, green space) on the temperature and mortality
   relation, and then predicting a range of effects based on plausible
   estimates for the future values of these parameters in a given city.
   Each approach can provide insight into how heat could affect mortality
   under a changing climate, but all have uncertainties. In spite of these
   limitations, projecting the future public health burden of
   temperature-related health effects can provide valuable information to
   aid public health and environmental authorities in planning and
   communicating the risks of climate change to the public. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Objectives To assess heat related mortalities in relation to climate
   within Europe.
   Design Observational population study.
   Setting North Finland, south Finland, Baden-Wurttemberg, Netherlands,
   London, north Italy, and Athens.
   Subjects People aged 65-74.
   Main outcome measures Mortalities at temperatures above, below and
   within each region's temperature band of minimum mortality.
   Results Mortality was lowest at 14.3-17.3 degrees C in north Finland but
   at 22.7-25.7 degrees C in Athens. Overall the 3 degrees C minimum
   mortality temperature bands were significantly higher in regions with
   higher than lower mean summer temperatures (P = 0.027). This was not due
   to regional differences in wind speeds, humidity, rain. As a result,
   regions with hot summers did not have significantly higher annual hear
   related mortality per million population than cold regions at
   temperatures above these bands. Mean annual heat related mortalities
   were 304 (95\% confidence interval 126 to 482) in North Finland, 445 (59
   to 831) in Athens, and 40 (13 to 68) in London. Cold related mortalities
   were 2457 (1130 to 3786), 2533 (965 to 4101), and 3129 (2319 to 3939)
   respectively.
   Conclusions Populations in Europe have adjusted successfully to mean
   summer temperatures ranging from 13.5 degrees C to 24.1 degrees C, and
   can be expected to adjust to global warming predicted for the next half
   century with little sustained increase in hear related mortality. Active
   measures to accelerate adjustment to hot weather could minimise
   temporary rises in heat related mortality, and measures to maintain
   protection against cold in winter could permit substantial reductions in
   overall mortality as temperatures rise.}},

Abstract = {{Episodes of extremely hot or cold temperatures are associated with

   temperature and mortality across a range of less extreme temperatures.
   In this paper, the authors describe the temperature-mortality
   association for 11 large eastern US cities in 1973-1994 by estimating
   the relative risks of mortality using log-linear regression analysis for
   time-series data and by exploring city characteristics associated with
   variations in this temperature-mortality relation. Current and recent
   days' temperatures were the weather components most strongly predictive
   of mortality, and mortality risk generally decreased as temperature
   increased from the coldest days to a certain threshold temperature,
   which varied by latitude, above which mortality risk increased as
   temperature increased. The authors also found a strong association of
   the temperature-mortality relation with latitude, with a greater effect
   of colder temperatures on mortality risk in more-southern cities and of
   warmer temperatures in more-northern cities. The percentage of
   households with air conditioners in the south and heaters in the north,
   which serve as indicators of socioeconomic status of the city
   population, also predicted weather-related mortality. The model
   developed in this analysis is potentially useful for projecting the

Abstract = {{Heat and heat waves are projected to increase in severity and frequency
   with increasing global mean temperatures. Studies in urban areas show an
   association between increases in mortality and increases in heat,
   measured by maximum or minimum temperature, heat index, and sometimes,
   other weather conditions. Health effects associated with exposure to
   extreme and prolonged heat appear to be related to environmental
   temperatures above those to which the population is accustomed. Models
   of weather-mortality relationships indicate that populations in
   northeastern and midwestern U.S. cities are likely to experience the
   greatest number of illnesses and deaths in response to changes in summer
   temperature. Physiologic and behavioral adaptations may reduce morbidity
   and mortality. Within heat-sensitive regions, urban populations are the
   most vulnerable to adverse heat-related health outcomes. The elderly,
   young children, the poor, and people who are bedridden or are on certain
   medications are at particular risk. Heat-related illnesses and deaths
   are largely preventable through behavioral adaptations, including the
   use of air conditioning and increased fluid intake. Overall death rates
   are higher in winter than in summer, and it is possible that milder
   winters could reduce deaths in winter months. However, the relationship
   between winter weather and mortality is difficult to interpret. Other
   adaptation measures include heat emergency plans, warning systems, and
   illness management plans. Research is needed to identify critical
   weather parameters, the associations between beat and nonfatal
   illnesses, the evaluation of implemented heat response plans, and the

  abstract={Extreme heat events are associated with spikes in mortality, yet death rates are on average highest during the coldest months of the year. Under the assumption that most winter excess mortality is due to cold temperature, many previous studies have concluded that winter mortality will substantially decline in a warming climate. We analyzed whether and to what extent cold temperatures are associated with excess winter mortality across multiple cities and over multiple years within individual cities, using daily temperature and mortality data from 36 US cities (1985–2006) and 3 French cities (1971–2007). Comparing across cities, we found that excess winter mortality did not depend on seasonal temperature range, and was no lower in warmer vs. colder cities, suggesting that temperature is not a key driver of winter excess mortality. Using regression models within monthly strata, we found that variability in daily mortality within cities was not strongly influenced by winter temperature. Finally we found that inadequate control for seasonality in analyses of the effects of cold temperatures led to spuriously large assumed cold effects, and erroneous attribution of winter mortality to cold temperatures. Our findings suggest that reductions in cold-related mortality under warming climate may be much smaller than some have assumed. This should be of interest to researchers and policy makers concerned with projecting future health effects of climate change and developing relevant adaptation strategies.}

   human health in many ways-mostly adversely. Here, we summarise the
   epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect
   various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that
   recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We
   review the published estimates of future health effects of climate
   change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on
   thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with
   some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger
   prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of
   health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of
   climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will
   strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide
   priorities for planned adaptive strategies.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely assumed by policymakers and health professionals that the
   harmful health impacts of anthropogenic climate change(1-3) will be
   partially offset by a decline in excess winter deaths (EWDs) in
   temperate countries, as winters warm(4-6). Recent UK government reports
   state that winter warming will decrease EWDs(7,8). Over the past few
   decades, however, the UK and other temperate countries have
   simultaneously experienced better housing, improved health care, higher
   incomes and greater awareness of the risks of cold. The link between
   winter temperatures and EWDs may therefore no longer be as strong as
   before. Here we report on the key drivers that underlie year-to-year
   variations in EWDs. We found that the association of year-to-year
   variation in EWDs with the number of cold days in winter (<5 degrees C),
   evident until the mid 1970s, has disappeared, leaving only the incidence
   of influenza-like illnesses to explain any of the year-to-year variation
   in EWDs in the past decade. Although EWDs evidently do exist, winter
   cold severity no longer predicts the numbers affected. We conclude that
   no evidence exists that EWDs in England and Wales will fall if winters
   warm with climate change. These findings have important implications for
   climate change health adaptation policies.}},

     abstract = {Time series methods are used to make long-run forecasts, with confidence intervals, of age-specific mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2065. First, the logs of the age-specific death rates are modeled as a linear function of an unobserved period-specific intensity index, with parameters depending on age. This model is fit to the matrix of U.S. death rates, 1933 to 1987, using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method; it accounts for almost all the variance over time in age-specific death rates as a group. Whereas e<sub>0</sub> has risen at a decreasing rate over the century and has decreasing variability, k(t) declines at a roughly constant rate and has roughly constant variability, facilitating forecasting. k(t), which indexes the intensity of mortality, is next modeled as a time series (specifically, a random walk with drift) and forecast. The method performs very well on within-sample forecasts, and the forecasts are insensitive to reductions in the length of the base period from 90 to 30 years; some instability appears for base periods of 10 or 20 years, however. Forecasts of age-specific rates are derived from the forecasts of k, and other life table variables are derived and presented. These imply an increase of 10.5 years in life expectancy to 86.05 in 2065 (sexes combined), with a confidence band of plus 3.9 or minus 5.6 years, including uncertainty concerning the estimated trend. Whereas 46% now survive to age 80, by 2065 46% will survive to age 90. Of the gains forecast for person-years lived over the life cycle from now until 2065, 74% will occur at age 65 and over. These life expectancy forecasts are substantially lower than direct time series forecasts of e<sub>0</sub>, and have far narrower confidence bands; however, they are substantially higher than the forecasts of the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary.},

   systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013}},

Abstract = {{Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specifi
   c all-cause and cause-specifi c mortality is essential for the formation
   of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden
   of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188
   countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether
   there is epidemiological convergence across countries.
   Methods We estimated age-sex-specifi c all-cause mortality using the GBD
   2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an
   updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We
   generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements
   included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72
   countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and
   detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey,
   and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code
   redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the
   240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant
   strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's
   disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of
   prevalence studies. For pathogen-specifi c causes of diarrhoea and lower
   respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed
   two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average
   relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and
   the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad
   findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose
   probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age
   15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age
   75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all
   quantities reported, we computed 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We
   constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year
   group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty
   distributions.
   Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years
   (UI 65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the
   number of deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9
   million (UI 53.6-56.3) over the same interval. Global progress masked
   variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute diff erences
   between countries decreased but relative diff erences increased. For
   women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49
   years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative diff erences
   increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed
   the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for
   cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and
   reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections,
   and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life
   expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes
   of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell
   whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have
   increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.
   Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7\%, from 4.3 million deaths
   in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over
   the same period by 21\%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per
   year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and
   2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and
   flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and
   sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections,
   neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death
   in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are
   rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory
   infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of
   life were substantially varied between and within regions.
   Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in
   age-sex specifi c mortality has been associated with a progressive shift
   towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by
   non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological
   convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative
   measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death
   rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the
   potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the
   empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for
   example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution is a heterogeneous, complex mixture of gases, liquids, and
   particulate matter. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a
   consistent increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both
   short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of ambient
   particulate matter. Several plausible mechanistic pathways have been
   described, including enhanced coagulation/thrombosis, a propensity for
   arrhythmias, acute arterial vasoconstriction, systemic inflammatory
   responses, and the chronic promotion of atherosclerosis. The purpose of
   this statement is to provide healthcare professionals and regulatory
   agencies with a comprehensive review of the literature on air pollution
   and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications of these
   findings in relation to public health and regulatory policies are
   addressed. Practical recommendations for healthcare providers and their
   patients are outlined. In the final section, suggestions for future
   research are made to address a number of remaining scientific questions.}},

   pollution - Epidemiological evidence of general pathophysiological
   pathways of disease}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{71-77}},
Month = {{Jan 6}},
Abstract = {{Background - Epidemiologic studies have linked long-term exposure to
   fine particulate matter air pollution ( PM) to broad cause-of-death
   mortality. Associations with specific cardiopulmonary diseases might be
   useful in exploring potential mechanistic pathways linking exposure and
   mortality.
   Methods and Results - General pathophysiological pathways linking
   long-term PM exposure with mortality and expected patterns of PM
   mortality with specific causes of death were proposed a priori. Vital
   status, risk factor, and cause-of-death data, collected by the American
   Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, were linked
   with air pollution data from United States metropolitan areas. Cox
   Proportional Hazard regression models were used to estimate PM-mortality
   associations with specific causes of death. Long-term PM exposures were
   most strongly associated with mortality attributable to ischemic heart
   disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. For these
   cardiovascular causes of death, a 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine PM was
   associated with 8\% to 18\% increases in mortality risk, with comparable
   or larger risks being observed for smokers relative to nonsmokers.
   Mortality attributable to respiratory disease had relatively weak
   associations.
   Conclusions - Fine particulate air pollution is a risk factor for
   cause-specific cardiovascular disease mortality via mechanisms that
   likely include pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerated
   atherosclerosis, and altered cardiac autonomic function. Although
   smoking is a much larger risk factor for cardiovascular disease
   mortality, exposure to fine PM imposes additional effects that seem to
   be at least additive to if not synergistic with smoking.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease (CVD) today is responsible for approximately
   one-third of deaths worldwide, and that figure will surely increase in
   both developing and developed countries as risk factors for the
   disease-primarily dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes,
   physical inactivity, poor diet, and smoking-continue to increase.
   Although these risk factors are modifiable, to date there is a relative
   paucity of measures to prevent or control them, particularly in
   developing countries. A population strategy combined with a high-risk
   strategy for CVD prevention could greatly reduce the burden of disease
   in the coming decades. Many initiatives are working, but many more are
   needed. This chapter provides background on the global burden of CVD and
   provides the context for the subsequent chapters addressing nurses'
   roles in reversing the bleak predictions for the ravages of CVD if risk
   factors are left unchecked in the coming decades.}},

   anthropogenic influences}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{May}},
Abstract = {{In 2014, Central England experienced its warmest year in a record
   extending back to 1659. Using both state-of-the-art climate models and
   empirical techniques, our analysis shows a substantial and significant
   increase in the likelihood of record-breaking warm years, such as 2014,
   due to human influences on climate. With 90\% confidence we find that
   anthropogenic forcings on the climate have increased the chances of
   record warm years in Central England by at least 13-fold. This study
   points  to a large influence of human activities on extreme warm years

Abstract = {{Often, in environmental data collection, data arise from two sources:
   numerical models and monitoring networks. The first source provides
   predictions at the level of grid cells, while the second source gives
   measurements at points. The first is characterized by full spatial
   coverage of the region of interest, high temporal resolution, no missing
   data but consequential calibration concerns. The second tends to be
   sparsely collected in space with coarser temporal resolution, often with
   missing data but, where recorded, provides, essentially, the true value.
   Accommodating the spatial misalignment between the two types of data is
   of fundamental importance for both improved predictions of exposure as
   well as for evaluation and calibration of the numerical model. In this
   article we propose a simple, fully model-based strategy to downscale the
   output from numerical models to point level. The static spatial model,
   specified within a Bayesian framework, regresses the observed data on
   the numerical model output using spatially-varying coefficients which
   are specified through a correlated spatial Gaussian process.
   As an example, we apply our method to ozone concentration data for the
   eastern U.S. and compare it to Bayesian melding (Fuentes and Raftery
   2005) and ordinary kriging (Cressie 1993; ChilSs and Delfiner 1999). Our
   results show that our method outperforms Bayesian melding in terms of
   computing speed and it is superior to both Bayesian melding and ordinary
   kriging in terms of predictive performance; predictions obtained with
   our method are better calibrated and predictive intervals have empirical
   coverage closer to the nominal values. Moreover, our model can be easily
   extended to accommodate for the temporal dimension. In this regard, we
   consider several spatio-temporal versions of the static model. We
   compare them using out-of-sample predictions of ozone concentration for
   the eastern U.S. for the period May 1-October 15, 2001. For the best
   choice, we present a summary of the analysis. Supplemental material,
   including color versions of Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and MCMC
   diagnostic plots, are available online.}},

Abstract = {{Warm temperatures adversely affect disease occurrence and death, in
   extreme conditions as well as when the temperature changes are more
   modest(1,2). Therefore climate change, which is expected to affect both
   average temperatures and temperature variability, is likely to impact
   health even in temperate climates. Climate change risk assessment is
   enriched if there is information on vulnerability and resilience to
   effects of temperature. Some studies have analysed socio-demographic
   characteristics that make individuals vulnerable to adverse effects of
   temperature(1-4). Less is known about community-level vulnerability. We
   used geo-coded mortality and environmental data and Bayesian spatial
   methods to conduct a national small-area analysis of the mortality
   effects of warm temperature for all 376 districts in England and Wales.
   In the most vulnerable districts, those in London and south/southeast
   England, odds of dying from cardiorespiratory causes increased by more
   than 10\% for 1 degrees C warmer temperature, compared with virtually no
   effect in the most resilient districts, which were in the far north. A 2
   degrees C warmer summer may result in 1,552 (95\% credible interval
   1,307-1,762) additional deaths, about one-half of which would occur in
   95 districts. The findings enable risk and adaptation analyses to
   incorporate local vulnerability to warm temperature and to quantify
   inequality in its effects.}},

   and 2010 events likely broke the 500-year-long seasonal temperature
   records over approximately 50\% of Europe. According to regional
   multi-model experiments, the probability of a summer experiencing
   mega-heatwaves will increase by a factor of 5 to 10 within the next 40
   years. However, the magnitude of the 2010 event was so extreme that
   despite this increase, the likelihood of an analog over the same region
   remains fairly low until the second half of the 21st century.}},

Abstract = {{Instrumental observations(1,2) and reconstructions(3,4) of global and
   hemispheric temperature evolution reveal a pronounced warming during the
   past similar to150 years. One expression of this warming is the observed
   increase in the occurrence of heatwaves(5,6). Conceptually this increase
   is understood as a shift of the statistical distribution towards warmer
   temperatures, while changes in the width of the distribution are often
   considered small(7). Here we show that this framework fails to explain
   the record- breaking central European summer temperatures in 2003,
   although it is consistent with observations from previous years. We find
   that an event like that of summer 2003 is statistically extremely
   unlikely, even when the observed warming is taken into account. We
   propose that a regime with an increased variability of temperatures ( in
   addition to increases in mean temperature) may be able to account for
   summer 2003. To test this proposal, we simulate possible future European
   climate with a regional climate model in a scenario with increased
   atmospheric greenhouse- gas concentrations, and find that temperature
   variability increases by up to 100\%, with maximum changes in central
   and eastern Europe.}},

   blocking episodes, soil moisture deficit, and sea surface temperatures.

   northern displacement of the North Atlantic subtropical high than a
   canonical blocking structure, and that soil moisture deficit was a key
   factor to reach unprecedented temperature anomalies. There are
   indications that the anomalous Mediterranean Sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) have contributed to the heat wave of 2003, whereas the role of
   SST anomalies in other oceanic regions is still under debate. There are
   methodological limitations to evaluate excess mortality due to excessive
   temperatures; however, the different studies available in the literature
   allow us to estimate that around 40,000 deaths were registered in Europe
   during the heat wave, mostly elderly persons. Despite previous efforts
   undertaken by a few cities to implement warning systems, this dramatic
   episode has highlighted the widespread un-preparedness of most civil and
   health authorities to cope with such large events. Therefore, the
   implementation of early warning systems in most European cities to
   mitigate the impact of extreme heat is the main consequence to diminish
   the impact of future similar events. In addition to mortality ( by far
   the most dramatic impact), we have also analyzed the record-breaking
   forest fires in Portugal and the evidence of other relevant impacts,
   including agriculture and air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for producing probabilistic
   forecasts of male period life expectancy at birth for all the countries
   of the world to 2100. Such forecasts would be an input to the production
   of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is
   currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the
   method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment,
   fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated
   model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions
   had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 \% less than the
   current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in
   the sense that, for example, the 80 \% prediction intervals contained
   the truth about 80 \% of the time. We illustrate our method with results
   from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life
   expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and
   Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South
   Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software

Title = {{Projections of global mortality and burden of disease from 2002 to 2030}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background Global and regional projections of mortality and burden of
   disease by cause for the years 2000, 2010, and 2030 were published by
   Murray and Lopez in 1996 as part of the Global Burden of Disease
   project. These projections, which are based on 1990 data, continue to be
   widely quoted, although they are substantially outdated; in particular,
   they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the
   widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global
   health, and thereby to support international health policy and priority
   setting, we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of
   disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of
   mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the
   methods, assumptions, input data, and results.
   Methods and Findings Relatively simple models were used to project
   future health trends under three scenarios baseline, optimistic, and
   pessimistic - based largely on projections of economic and social
   development, and using the historically observed relationships of these
   with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to
   take account of the greater availability of death registration data and
   the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS, income, human capital,
   tobacco smoking, body mass index, and other inputs. In all three
   scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from
   younger to older ages and from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and
   nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death
   for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50\% in the
   baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to
   noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59\% in 2002 to 69\%
   in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million
   in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario, which
   assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80\% by 2012. Under
   the optimistic scenario, which also assumes increased prevention
   activity, HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030.
   Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million
   in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our
   baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50\% more people in 2015
   than HIV/AIDS, and to be responsible for 10\% of all deaths globally.
   The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to
   include HIV/AIDS, unipolar depressive disorders, and ischaemic heart
   disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic
   accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario, and the
   third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic
   scenario. Under the baseline scenario, HIV/AIDS becomes the leading
   cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015.
   Conclusions These projections represent a set of three visions of the
   future for population health, based on certain explicit assumptions.
   Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections, they
   enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health
   policy of currently observed trends, and the likely impact of fairly
   certain future trends, such as the ageing of the population, the
   continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions, and the continuation of
   the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results
   depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor
   countries will have a relationship to economic and social development
   similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries.}},

Abstract = {{The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and

   years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human

   transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.
   Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of
   diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality
   data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and
   changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing
   evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks
   under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend
   over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity ande
   mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions
   include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm
   disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans

abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACTContinuing increases in life expectancy beyond previously-held limits have brought to the fore the critical importance of mortality forecasting. Significant developments in mortality forecasting since 1980 are reviewed under three broad approaches: expectation, extrapolation and explanation. Expectation is not generally a good basis for mortality forecasting, as it is subjective; expert expectations are invariably conservative. Explanation is restricted to certain causes of death with known determinants. Decomposition by cause of death poses problems associated with the lack of independence among causes and data difficulties. Most developments have been in extrapolative forecasting, and make use of statistical methods rather than models developed primarily for age-specific graduation. Methods using two-factor models (age-period or age-cohort) have been most successful. The two-factor Lee–Carter method, and, in particular, its variants, have been successful in terms of accuracy, while recent advances have improved the estimation of forecast uncertainty. Regression-based (GLM) methods have been less successful, due to nonlinearities in time. Three-factor methods are more recent; the Lee–Carter age-period-cohort model appears promising. Specialised software has been developed and made available. Research needs include further comparative evaluations of methods in terms of the accuracy of the point forecast and its uncertainty, encompassing a wide range of mortality situations. }

Abstract = {{Objective: Much debate remains regarding why certain countries
   experience dramatically higher winter mortality. Potential causative
   factors other than cold exposure have rarely been analysed.
   Comparatively less research exists on excess winter deaths in southern
   Europe. Multiple time series data on a variety of risk factors are
   analysed against seasonal-mortality patterns in 14 European countries to
   identify key relations
   Subjects and setting: Excess winter deaths ( all causes), 1988 - 97,
   EU-14.
   Design: Coefficients of seasonal variation in mortality are calculated
   for EU-14 using monthly mortality data. Comparable, longitudinal
   datasets on risk factors pertaining to climate, macroeconomy, health
   care, lifestyle, socioeconomics, and housing were also obtained. Poisson
   regression identifies seasonality relations over time.
   Results: Portugal suffers from the highest rates of excess winter
   mortality (28\%, CI = 25\% to 31\%) followed jointly by Spain (21\%, CI
   = 19\% to 23\%), and Ireland ( 21\%, CI = 18\% to 24\%). Cross country
   variations in mean winter environmental temperature ( regression
   coefficient (beta) = 0.27), mean winter relative humidity (beta = 0.54),
   parity adjusted per capita national income (beta = 1.08), per capita
   health expenditure (beta = 1.19), rates of income poverty (beta =
   20.47), inequality (beta = 0.97), deprivation (beta = 0.11), and fuel
   poverty (beta = 0.44), and several indicators of residential thermal
   standards are found to be significantly related to variations in
   relative excess winter mortality at the 5\% level. The strong, positive
   relation with environmental temperature and strong negative relation
   with thermal efficiency indicate that housing standards in southern and
   western Europe play strong parts in such seasonality.
   Conclusions: High seasonal mortality in southern and western Europe
   could be reduced through improved protection from the cold indoors,
   increased public spending on health care, and improved socioeconomic
   circumstances resulting in more equitable income distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Background Seasonal patterns in mortality have been recognized for many
   years. This study assesses seasonal variation in mortality in Scotland
   between 1981 and 1993 and considers its association with socioeconomic
   status and outdoor temperature.
   Methods Lagged Poisson regression analysis of numbers of deaths and
   average weekly temperature with adjustment for serial autocorrelation
   and influenza epidemics.
   Results There was significant seasonal variation in weekly death rates
   with a difference of about 30\% between a summer trough and a winter
   peak. This variation was principally attributable to respiratory
   disease, cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease. Seasonal
   variation in mortality fell from around 38\% in 1981-1983 to around 26\%
   in 1991-1993. There was no clear evidence of a relationship between
   socioeconomic status and seasonal mortality, however the extent of the
   fall in seasonal variation was greater in deprived areas than in
   affluent areas. Overall, a 1 degrees C decrease in mean temperature was
   associated with a 1\% increase in deaths one week later. The lag in this
   relationship varied by cause of death and underlying temperature.
   Conclusions Seasonal variations in mortality and the relationship
   between temperature and mortality are a significant public health
   problem in Scotland. It is likely that the strength of this relationship
   is a result of the population being unable to protect themselves
   adequately from the effects of temperature rather than the effects of
   temperature itself.}},

   approach, the overlaid network algorithm, to develop a series of
   improved methods for tackling the population interpolation problem based
   on current GIS techniques and available digital information. The term
   network means that the partitioning of population for source zones is
   carried our over street segments. People are sheltered by houses which
   are located along the sides of streets or connected by roads. Thus the
   street network provides an important information about the spatial
   distribution of population. The network length method discerns an even
   population distribution along one-dimensional line. The network
   hierarchical weighting method observes variations of residential density
   among different classes of streets. The network house bearing method
   breaks the assumptions of even population distribution over one and two
   dimensions and provides an automatic way of enumerating population over
   space. The application of these techniques to the interpolation of
   population in Erie County, New York improves the performance of areal
   interpolation significantly when compared with traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts
   typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as
   if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the
   uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and
   decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model
   averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this
   model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently
   emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In
   these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive
   performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA
   software.}},

year = {2015}, 
doi = {10.1073/pnas.1518393112}, 
abstract ={This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.},

Abstract = {{Background Few cohort studies of the health effects of urban air
   pollution have been published. There is evidence, most consistently in
   studies with individual measurement of social factors, that more
   deprived populations are particularly sensitive to air pollution
   effects.
   Methods Records from the 1996 New Zealand census were anonymously and
   probabilistically linked to mortality data, creating a cohort study of
   the New Zealand population followed up for 3 years. There were 1.06
   million adults living in urban areas for which data were available on
   all covariates. Estimates of exposure to air pollution (measured as
   particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m, PM10)
   were available for census area units from a previous land use regression
   study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate
   associations between cause-specific mortality rates and average exposure
   to PM10 in urban areas, with control for confounding by age, sex,
   ethnicity, social deprivation, income, education, smoking history and
   ambient temperature.
   Results The odds of all-cause mortality in adults (aged 30-74 years at
   census) increased by 7\% per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in average PM10
   exposure (95\% CI 3\% to 10\%) and 20\% per 10 mu g/m(3) among Maori,
   but with wide CI (7\% to 33\%). Associations were stronger for
   respiratory and lung cancer deaths.
   Conclusions An association of PM10 with mortality is reported in a
   country with relatively low levels of air pollution. The major
   limitation of the study is the probable misclassification of PM10
   exposure. On balance, this means the strength of association was
   probably underestimated. The apparently greater association among Maori
   might be due to different levels of co-morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Background New Zealand is a temperate country with substantial excess
   winter mortality. We investigated whether this excess winter mortality
   varies with social factors.
   Methods Records from New Zealand censuses in 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996 and
   2001 were each anonymously and probabilistically linked to 3 years of
   subsequent mortality data creating five cohort studies of the New
   Zealand adult population (age 30-74 years at census) each with 3 years'
   follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the risk of
   dying in winter compared to summer with winter deaths classified `1' and
   summer deaths `0'. There were 75 138 eligible mortality records with
   complete data on social variables recorded for 58 683 (78\%).
   Results Adjusting for age, sex, census year, ethnicity and tenure, those
   in the lowest tertile of income were at increased risk of winter death
   compared to those in the highest tertile: OR 1.13 (95\% CI 1.08 to
   1.19). Compared to home owners, people living in rented accommodation
   were at greater risk of winter death: OR 1.05 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.10).
   Urban dwellers were also at significantly increased risk. The strongest
   associations were seen for infectious diseases.
   Conclusions There was an increased risk of dying in winter for most New
   Zealanders, but more so among low-income people, those living in rented
   accommodation and those living in cities. Exact causal mechanisms are
   not known but possibly include correlated poorer health status, low
   indoor temperatures and household crowding.}},

Abstract = {{Emissions from landscape fires affect both climate and air quality(1).
   Here, we combine satellite-derived fire estimates and atmospheric
   modelling to quantify health effects from fire emissions in southeast
   Asia from 1997 to 2006. This region has large interannual variability in
   fire activity owing to coupling between El Nino-induced droughts and
   anthropogenic land-use change(2,3). We show that during strong El Nino
   years, fires contribute up to 200 mu g m(-3) and 50 ppb in annual
   average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone surface concentrations
   near fire sources, respectively. This corresponds to a fire contribution
   of 200 additional days per year that exceed the World Health
   Organization 50 mu g m(-3) 24-hr PM2.5 interim target(4) and an
   estimated 10,800 (6,800-14,300)-person (similar to 2\%) annual increase

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the principal respiratory pathogen in cystic
   fibrosis (CF) patients, is ubiquitous in the environment. Initial
   P.aeruginosa isolates in CF patients are generally environmental in
   nature. However, little information regarding seasonality of
   P.aeruginosa acquisition is available. We conducted a retrospective
   study to evaluate the seasonality of initial P.aeruginosa acquisition in
   young children with CF in the USA using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
   National Patient Registry from 2003 to 2009. Additionally, we assessed
   whether seasonal acquisition varied by climate zone. A total of 4123
   children met inclusion criteria and 45\% (n=1866) acquired P.aeruginosa
   during a mean 2.0years (SD 0.2years) of follow up. Compared with winter,
   increased P.aeruginosa acquisition was observed in summer (incidence
   rate ratio (IRR): 1.22; 95\% CI: 1.07-1.40) and autumn (IRR: 1.34; 95\%
   CI: 1.18-1.52), with lower acquisition observed in spring (IRR: 0.81;
   95\% CI: 0.70-0.94). Seasonal variations in P.aeruginosa acquisition
   rates in the temperate and continental climate zones were similar to
   those in the overall cohort. In contrast, no significant seasonal effect
   was observed in the dry climate zone. In a corresponding analysis, no
   seasonal difference was observed in the rate of acquisition of
   Staphylococcus aureus, another common CF respiratory pathogen. These
   results provide preliminary support that climatic factors may be
   associated with initial P.aeruginosa acquisition in CF patients.
   Investigation and identification of specific risk factors, as well as
   awareness of seasonal variation, could potentially inform clinical
   recommendations including increased awareness of infection control and
   prevention strategies.}},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations between meteorological and geographical factors and risk of initial Pa acquisition in young children with CF. Using the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry from 2003 to 2009, 3463 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 48% (n = 1659) acquired Pa during follow-up. From multivariable Weibull regression, increased risk of Pa acquisition was associated with increasing temperature [hazard ratio (HR) per 1 °C: 1·13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·08–1·13], dew point (HR per 1 °C: 1·10, 95% CI 1·07–1·13), rainfall (HR per cm: 1·10, 95% CI 1·07–1·12), latitude (HR per 1 °C northing: 1·15, 95% CI 1·11–1·20), longitude (HR per 1 °C easting: 1·01, 95% CI 1·01–1·02) and elevation (HR per 100 m: 1·05, 95% CI 1·03–1·07). These results suggest that environmental factors may play a previously unrecognized role in the aetiology of initial Pa acquisition. }

   Methods and Results We have designed algorithms for analyzing ambulatory
   ECG recordings and measuring HRV without human intervention, using
   robust methods for obtaining time-domain measures (mean and SD of heart
   rate), frequency-domain measures (power in the bands of 0.001 to 0.01 Hz
   {[}VLF], 0.01 to 0.15 Hz {[}LF], and 0.15 to 0.5 Hz {[}HF] and total
   spectral power {[}TP] over all three of these bands), and measures based
   on nonlinear dynamics (approximate entropy {[}ApEn], a measure of
   complexity, and detrended fluctuation analysis {[}DFA], a measure of
   long-term correlations). The study population consisted of chronic
   congestive heart failure (CHF) case patients and sex- and age-matched
   control subjects in the Framingham Heart Study. After exclusion of
   technically inadequate studies and those with atrial fibrillation, we
   used these algorithms to study HRV in 2-hour ambulatory ECG recordings
   of 69 participants (mean age, 71.7+/-8.1 years). By use of separate Cox
   proportional-hazards models, the conventional measures SD (P<.01), LF
   (P<.01), VLF (P<.05), and TP (P<.01) and the nonlinear measure DFA
   (P<.05) were predictors of survival over a mean follow-up period of 1.9
   years; other measures, including ApEn (P>.3), were not. In multivariable
   models, DFA was of borderline predictive significance (P=.06) after
   adjustment for the diagnosis of CHF and SD.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate that HRV analysis of ambulatory
   ECG recordings based on fully automated methods can have prognostic
   value in a population-based study and that nonlinear HRV indices may
   contribute prognostic value to complement traditional HRV measures.}},

Abstract = {{An innovations state space modeling framework is introduced for
   forecasting complex seasonal time series such as those with multiple
   seasonal periods, high-frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality,
   and dual-calendar effects. The new framework incorporates Box-Cox
   transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients,
   and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical
   expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the
   assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple,
   comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A
   key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that
   greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood
   estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of
   applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical
   studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is
   presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it
   is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and
   extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in
   the time series plot itself.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive nonlinear state space-based modelling system has been
   designed to predict daily mean concentrations of PM10 for Bordeaux
   metropolitan area. The nonlinear model structure is based on empirical
   relationships between the measured PM10 and other primary pollutants and
   meteorological variables. An Extended Kalman filter algorithm is used to
   estimate 1-day ahead prediction of the extended state, containing model
   parameters and daily mean PM10. A key characteristic of such a system is
   that its behaviour can be adapted to the short-term changes of air
   pollution and consequently the model can handle the time-evolving nature
   of the phenomena and does not need frequent adjustments. The method is
   applied to data from a monitoring site in Bordeaux (south France).
   Experimental results show that the model accurately predicts daily mean
   PM10. The application of the Extended Kalman filter explains about 70\%
   of the variance with an absolute mean error less than 4.5 mu g/m(3). The
   approximate index of agreement value for the period covered is 0.90. (C)

Journal = {{Journal of Machine Learning Research}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{2337-2397}},
%Month = {{Jul}},
Abstract = {{Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating
   solutions to differential equations within non-parametric inference
   methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be
   inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form
   solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world
   problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given
   this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably
   improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their
   applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near
   periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to
   approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that
   the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop
   a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our
   approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show
   that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the
   homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which
   quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both
   cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently
   using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via
   LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic
   latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17\% of
   that from non-periodic models and 27\% of the nearest rival approach
   which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al.,
   2012).}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-59}},
Abstract = {{With the advent of routine health data indexed at a fine geographical
   resolution, small area disease mapping studies have become an
   established technique in geographical epidemiology. The specific issues
   posed by the sparseness of the data and possibility for local spatial
   dependence belong to a generic class of statistical problems involving
   an underlying (latent) spatial process of interest corrupted by
   observational noise. These are naturally formulated within the framework
   of hierarchical models, and over the past decade, a variety of spatial
   models have been proposed for the latent level(s) of the hierarchy. In
   this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the main classes of
   such models that have been used for disease mapping within a Bayesian
   estimation paradigm, and report a performance comparison between
   representative models in these classes, using a set of simulated data to
   help illustrate their respective properties. We also consider recent
   extensions to model the joint spatial distribution of multiple disease
   or health indicators. The aim is to help the reader choose an
   appropriate structural prior for the second level of the hierarchical
   model and to discuss issues of sensitivity to this choice.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonality, a periodic surge in disease incidence corresponding to
   seasons or other calendar periods, characterizes many infectious
   diseases of public health importance. The recognition of seasonal
   patterns in infectious disease occurrence dates back at least as far as
   the Hippocratic era, but mechanisms underlying seasonality of
   person-to-person transmitted diseases are not well understood. Improved
   understanding will enhance understanding of host-pathogen interactions
   and will improve the accuracy of public health surveillance and
   forecasting systems. Insight into seasonal disease patterns may be
   gained through the use of autocorrelation methods or construction of
   periodograms, while seasonal oscillation of infectious diseases can be
   easily simulated using simple transmission models. Models demonstrate
   that small seasonal changes in host or pathogen factors may be
   sufficient to create large seasonal surges in disease incidence, which
   may be important particularly in the context of global climate change.

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal prediction of levels of an environmental exposure is an
   important problem in environmental epidemiology. Our work is motivated
   by multiple studies on the spatio-temporal distribution of mobile
   source, or traffic related, particles in the greater Boston area. When
   multiple sources of exposure information are available, a joint model
   that pools information across sources maximizes data coverage over both
   space and time, thereby reducing the prediction error.
   We consider a Bayesian hierarchical framework in which a joint model
   consists of a set of submodels, one for each data source, and a model
   for the latent process that serves to relate the submodels to one
   another. If a submodel depends on the latent process nonlinearly,
   inference using standard MCMC techniques can be computationally
   prohibitive. The implications are particularly severe when the data for
   each submodel are aggregated at different temporal scales.
   To make such problems tractable, we linearize the nonlinear components
   with respect to the latent process and induce sparsity in the covariance
   matrix of the latent process using compactly supported covariance
   functions. We propose an efficient MCMC scheme that takes advantage of
   these approximations. We use our model to address a temporal change of
   support problem whereby interest focuses on pooling daily and multiday
   black carbon readings in order to maximize the spatial coverage of the

Title = {{A scoping review of malaria forecasting: past work and future directions}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: There is a growing body of literature on malaria forecasting
   methods and the objective of our review is to identify and assess
   methods, including predictors, used to forecast malaria.
   Design: Scoping review. Two independent reviewers searched information
   sources, assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data from each
   study.
   Information sources: Search strategies were developed and the following
   databases were searched: CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE,
   ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses and Web of Science. Key journals and
   websites were also manually searched.
   Eligibility criteria for included studies: We included studies that
   forecasted incidence, prevalence or epidemics of malaria over time. A
   description of the forecasting model and an assessment of the forecast
   accuracy of the model were requirements for inclusion. Studies were
   restricted to human populations and to autochthonous transmission
   settings.
   Results: We identified 29 different studies that met our inclusion
   criteria for this review. The forecasting approaches included
   statistical modelling, mathematical modelling and machine learning
   methods. Climate-related predictors were used consistently in
   forecasting models, with the most common predictors being rainfall,
   relative humidity, temperature and the normalised difference vegetation
   index. Model evaluation was typically based on a reserved portion of
   data and accuracy was measured in a variety of ways including
   mean-squared error and correlation coefficients. We could not compare
   the forecast accuracy of models from the different studies as the
   evaluation measures differed across the studies.
   Conclusions: Applying different forecasting methods to the same data,
   exploring the predictive ability of non-environmental variables,
   including transmission reducing interventions and using common forecast
   accuracy measures will allow malaria researchers to compare and improve
   models and methods, which should improve the quality of malaria
   forecasting.}},

   mortality. Coupled with Hadley CM3 climate-change predictions, I project
   that mortality rates are likely to change little on the aggregate for
   the United States. However, distributional impacts matter: mortality
   rates are likely to decline in cold and dry areas, but increase in hot
   and humid areas. Further, accounting for humidity has important
   implications for evaluating these distributional effects. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Global average temperatures have been rising for the past half-century,
   and the warming trend has accelerated in recent decades(1). Further
   warming is expected over the next few decades, with significant regional
   variations. These warming trends will probably result in more frequent,
   intense and persistent periods of hot temperatures in summer, and
   generally higher temperatures in winter. Daily death counts in cities
   increase markedly when temperatures reach levels that are very high
   relative to what is normal in a given location(2-4). Relatively cold
   temperatures also seem to carry risk(2,4). Rising temperatures may
   result in more heat-related mortality but may also reduce cold-related
   mortality, and the net impact on annual mortality remains uncertain.
   Here we use 16 downscaled global climate models and two emissions
   scenarios to estimate present and future seasonal patterns in
   temperature-related mortality in Manhattan, New York. All 32 projections
   yielded warm-season increases and cold-season decreases in
   temperature-related mortality, with positive net annual
   temperature-related deaths in all cases. Monthly analyses showed that
   the largest percentage increases may occur in May and September. These
   results suggest that, over a range of models and scenarios of future
   greenhouse gas emissions, increases in heat-related mortality could
   outweigh reductions in cold-related mortality, with shifting seasonal
   patterns.}},

   on oppressive air mass days is actually just as large in spring as it is
   in summer, and in some cases is larger. Late summer and autumn
   vulnerability to anomalously warm or hot days is much less significant

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Much debate remains regarding why certain countries
   experience dramatically higher winter mortality. Potential causative
   factors other than cold exposure have rarely been analysed.
   Comparatively less research exists on excess winter deaths in southern
   Europe. Multiple time series data on a variety of risk factors are
   analysed against seasonal-mortality patterns in 14 European countries to
   identify key relations
   Subjects and setting: Excess winter deaths ( all causes), 1988 - 97,
   EU-14.
   Design: Coefficients of seasonal variation in mortality are calculated
   for EU-14 using monthly mortality data. Comparable, longitudinal
   datasets on risk factors pertaining to climate, macroeconomy, health
   care, lifestyle, socioeconomics, and housing were also obtained. Poisson
   regression identifies seasonality relations over time.
   Results: Portugal suffers from the highest rates of excess winter
   mortality (28\%, CI = 25\% to 31\%) followed jointly by Spain (21\%, CI
   = 19\% to 23\%), and Ireland ( 21\%, CI = 18\% to 24\%). Cross country
   variations in mean winter environmental temperature ( regression
   coefficient (beta) = 0.27), mean winter relative humidity (beta = 0.54),
   parity adjusted per capita national income (beta = 1.08), per capita
   health expenditure (beta = 1.19), rates of income poverty (beta =
   20.47), inequality (beta = 0.97), deprivation (beta = 0.11), and fuel
   poverty (beta = 0.44), and several indicators of residential thermal
   standards are found to be significantly related to variations in
   relative excess winter mortality at the 5\% level. The strong, positive
   relation with environmental temperature and strong negative relation
   with thermal efficiency indicate that housing standards in southern and
   western Europe play strong parts in such seasonality.
   Conclusions: High seasonal mortality in southern and western Europe
   could be reduced through improved protection from the cold indoors,
   increased public spending on health care, and improved socioeconomic
   circumstances resulting in more equitable income distribution.}},

Journal = {{Epidemiology}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many studies have linked weather to mortality; however, role
   of such critical factors as regional variation, susceptible populations,
   and acclimatization remain unresolved.
   Methods: We applied time-series models to 107 US communities allowing a
   nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality by using a
   14-year dataset. Second-stage analysis was used to relate cold, heat,
   and heat wave effect estimates to community-specific variables. We
   considered exposure timeframe, susceptibility, age, cause of death, and
   confounding from pollutants. Heat waves were modeled with varying
   intensity and duration.
   Results: Heat-related mortality was most associated with a shorter lag
   (average of same day and previous day), with an overall increase of
   3.0\% (95\% posterior interval: 2.4\%-3.6\%) in mortality risk comparing
   the 99th and 90th percentile temperatures for the community.
   Cold-related mortality was most associated with a longer lag (average of
   current day up to 25 days previous), with a 4.2\% (3.2\%-5.3\%) increase
   in risk comparing the first and 10th percentile temperatures for the
   community. Mortality risk increased with the intensity or duration of
   heat waves. Spatial heterogeneity in effects indicates that
   weather-mortality relationships from I community may not be applicable
   in another. Larger spatial heterogeneity for absolute temperature
   estimates (comparing risk at specific temperatures) than for relative
   temperature estimates (comparing risk at community-specific temperature
   percentiles) provides evidence for acclimatization. We identified
   susceptibility based on age, socioeconomic conditions, urbanicity, and
   central air conditioning.
   Conclusions: Acclimatization, individual susceptibility, and community
   characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.}},

Title = {{Declining vulnerability to temperature-related mortality in London over

Abstract = {{The degree to which population vulnerability to outdoor temperature is
   reduced by improvements in infrastructure, technology, and general
   health has an important bearing on what realistically can be expected
   with future changes in climate. Using autoregressive Poisson models with
   adjustment for season, the authors analyzed weekly mortality in London,
   United Kingdom, during four periods (1900-1910, 1927-1937, 1954-1964,
   and 1986-1996) to quantify changing vulnerability to seasonal and
   temperature-related mortality throughout the 20th century. Mortality
   patterns showed an epidemiologic transition over the century from high
   childhood mortality to low childhood mortality and towards a
   predominance of chronic disease mortality in later periods. The ratio of
   winter deaths to nonwinter deaths was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.16, 1.34) in 1900-1910, 1.54 (95\% CI: 1.42, 1.68) in 1927-1937,
   1.48 (95\% CI: 1.35, 1.64) in 1954-1964, and 1.22 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.31)
   in 1986-1996. The temperature-mortality gradient for cold deaths
   diminished progressively: The increase in mortality per 1 degrees C drop
   below 15 degrees C was 2.52\% (95\% CI: 2.00, 3.03), 2.34\% (95\% CI:
   1.72, 2.96), 1.64\% (1.10, 2.19), and 1.17\% (95\% CI: 0.88, 1.45),
   respectively, in the four periods. Corresponding population attributable
   fractions were 12.5\%, 11.2\%, 8.7\%, and 5.4\%. Heat deaths also
   diminished over the century. There was a progressive reduction in
   temperature-related deaths over the 20th century, despite an aging
   population. This trend is likely to reflect improvements in social,
   environmental, behavioral, and health-care factors and has implications
   for the assessment of future burdens of heat and cold mortality.}},

Journal = {{PLoS One}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
%Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality has been shown to
   follow a seasonal pattern. Several studies suggested several possible
   determinants of this pattern, including misclassification of causes of
   deaths. We aimed at assessing seasonality in overall, CVD, cancer and
   non-CVD/non-cancer mortality using data from 19 countries from different
   latitudes.
   Methods and Findings: Monthly mortality data were compiled from 19
   countries, amounting to over 54 million deaths. We calculated ratios of
   the observed to the expected numbers of deaths in the absence of a
   seasonal pattern. Seasonal variation (peak to nadir difference) for
   overall and cause-specific (CVD, cancer or non-CVD/non-cancer) mortality
   was analyzed using the cosinor function model. Mortality from overall,
   CVD and non-CVD/non-cancer showed a consistent seasonal pattern. In both
   hemispheres, the number of deaths was higher than expected in winter. In
   countries close to the Equator the seasonal pattern was considerably
   lower for mortality from any cause. For CVD mortality, the peak to nadir
   differences ranged from 0.185 to 0.466 in the Northern Hemisphere, from
   0.087 to 0.108 near the Equator, and from 0.219 to 0.409 in the Southern
   Hemisphere. For cancer mortality, the seasonal variation was nonexistent
   in most countries.
   Conclusions: In countries with seasonal variation, mortality from
   overall, CVD and non-CVD/non-cancer show a seasonal pattern with
   mortality being higher in winter than in summer. Conversely, cancer
   mortality shows no substantial seasonality.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used
   class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others,
   (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing
   spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial
   and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical
   and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a
   popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian
   models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few
   hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior
   marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian
   response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
   can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both
   convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the
   extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
   is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by
   using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified
   version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the
   posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is
   computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or
   days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in
   seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its
   generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an
   automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and
   various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model
   under study can be challenged.}},

Abstract = {{TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of
   complex nonlinear random effects (latent variable) models in a manner
   similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB,
   http://admb-project.org/; Fournier et al. 2011). In addition, it offers
   easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint
   likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template
   function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in
   the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation
   of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically
   integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained
   using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint
   likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with
   many random effects (approximate to 10(6)) and parameters (approximate
   to 10(3)). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite
   of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the
   random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to
   about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems.}},

Abstract = {{A revised framework is presented that quantifies observed changes in the
   climate of the contiguous United States through analysis of a revised
   version of the U.S. Climate Extremes Index (CEI). The CEI is based on a
   set of climate extremes indicators that measure the fraction of the area
   of the United States experiencing extremes in monthly mean surface
   temperature, daily precipitation, and drought (or moisture surplus). In
   the revised CEI, auxiliary station data, including recently digitized
   pre-1948 data, are incorporated to extend it further back in time and to
   improve spatial coverage. The revised CEI is updated for the period from
   1910 to the present in near-real time and is calculated for eight
   separate seasons, or periods. Results for the annual revised CEI are
   similar to those from the original CEI. Observations over the past
   decade continue to support the finding that the area experiencing much
   above-normal maximum and minimum temperatures in recent years has been
   on the rise, with infrequent occurrence of much below-normal mean
   maximum and minimum temperatures. Conversely, extremes in much
   below-normal mean maximum and minimum temperatures indicate a decline
   from about 1910 to 1930. An increasing trend in the area experiencing
   much above-normal proportion of heavy daily precipitation is observed
   from about 1950 to the present. A period with a much greater-than-normal
   number of days without precipitation is also noted from about 1910 to
   the mid-1930s. Warm extremes in mean maximum and minimum temperature
   observed during the summer and warm seasons show a more pronounced
   increasing trend since the mid-1970s. Results from the winter season
   show large variability in extremes and little evidence of a trend. The
   cold season CEI indicates an increase in extremes since the early 1970s
   yet has large multidecadal variability.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in
   which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an
   information theoretic argument we derive a measure P-D for the effective
   number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior
   mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the
   parameters of interest. In general P-D approximately corresponds to the
   trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior
   covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix
   projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in
   exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is
   suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the
   contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can
   give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages.
   Adding P-D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information
   criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information
   criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The
   procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn
   with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is
   emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a
   Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.}},

Title = {{The future of life expectancy and life expectancy inequalities in
   England and Wales: Bayesian spatiotemporal forecasting}},

Abstract = {{Background To plan for pensions and health and social services, future
   mortality and life expectancy need to be forecast. Consistent forecasts
   for all subnational units within a country are very rare. Our aim was to
   forecast mortality and life expectancy for England and Wales' districts.
   Methods We developed Bayesian spatiotemporal models for forecasting of
   age-specific mortality and life expectancy at a local, small-area level.
   The models included components that accounted for mortality in relation
   to age, birth cohort, time, and space. We used geocoded mortality and
   population data between 1981 and 2012 from the Office for National
   Statistics together with the model with the smallest error to forecast
   age-specific death rates and life expectancy to 2030 for 375 of England
   and Wales' 376 districts. We measured model performance by withholding
   recent data and comparing forecasts with this withheld data.
   Findings Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales was 79.5 years
   (95\% credible interval 79.5-79.6) for men and 83.3 years (83.3-83.4)
   for women in 2012. District life expectancies ranged between 75.2 years
   (74.9-75.6) and 83.4 years (82.1-84.8) for men and between 80.2 years
   (79.8-80.5) and 87.3 years (86.0-88.8) for women. Between 1981 and 2012,
   life expectancy increased by 8.2 years for men and 6.0 years for women,
   closing the female-male gap from 6.0 to 3.8 years. National life
   expectancy in 2030 is expected to reach 85.7 (84.2-87.4) years for men
   and 87.6 (86.7-88.9) years for women, further reducing the female
   advantage to 1.9 years. Life expectancy will reach or surpass 81.4 years
   for men and reach or surpass 84.5 years for women in every district by
   2030. Longevity inequality across districts, measured as the difference
   between the 1st and 99th percentiles of district life expectancies, has
   risen since 1981, and is forecast to rise steadily to 8.3 years
   (6.8-9.7) for men and 8.3 years (7.1-9.4) for women by 2030.
   Interpretation Present forecasts underestimate the expected rise in life
   expectancy, especially for men, and hence the need to provide improved
   health and social services and pensions for elderly people in England
   and Wales. Health and social policies are needed to curb widening life
   expectancy inequalities, help deprived districts catch up in longevity
   gains, and avoid a so-called grand divergence in health and longevity.}},

Abstract = {{Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specifi
   c all-cause and cause-specifi c mortality is essential for the formation
   of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden
   of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188
   countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether
   there is epidemiological convergence across countries.
   Methods We estimated age-sex-specifi c all-cause mortality using the GBD
   2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an
   updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We
   generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements
   included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72
   countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and
   detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey,
   and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code
   redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the
   240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant
   strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's
   disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of
   prevalence studies. For pathogen-specifi c causes of diarrhoea and lower
   respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed
   two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average
   relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and
   the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad
   findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose
   probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age
   15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age
   75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all
   quantities reported, we computed 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We
   constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year
   group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty
   distributions.
   Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years
   (UI 65.0-65.6) in 1990, to 71.5 years (UI 71.0-71.9) in 2013, while the
   number of deaths increased from 47.5 million (UI 46.8-48.2) to 54.9
   million (UI 53.6-56.3) over the same interval. Global progress masked
   variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute diff erences
   between countries decreased but relative diff erences increased. For
   women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49
   years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative diff erences
   increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed
   the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for
   cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and
   reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections,
   and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life
   expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes
   of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell
   whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have
   increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.
   Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7\%, from 4.3 million deaths
   in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over
   the same period by 21\%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per
   year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and
   2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and
   flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and
   sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections,
   neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death
   in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are
   rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory
   infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of
   life were substantially varied between and within regions.
   Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in
   age-sex specifi c mortality has been associated with a progressive shift
   towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by
   non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological
   convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative
   measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death
   rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the
   potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the
   empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for
   example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.}},
